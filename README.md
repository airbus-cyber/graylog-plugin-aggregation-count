#### Alert condition plugin for Graylog to perform aggregation

The alert condition triggers whenever the stream received more or less than X messages matching the same values of some message fields and with distinct values of other message fields in the last Y minutes.

Perfect for example to be alerted when there are brute-force attempts on your platform. Create a stream that catches every authentification failure and be alerted when that stream exceeds a given threshold per user.

Also perfect for example to be alerted when there are network port scans on your platform. Create a stream that catches your network traffic and be alerted when that stream exceeds a given threshold per source and per destination and with distinct values of port.

Please also take note that only a single alert is raised for this condition during the alerting interval, although multiple messages containing different values for the message fields may have been received since the last alert.

**Required Graylog version:** 3.0.0 and later

Example of raised alert:
